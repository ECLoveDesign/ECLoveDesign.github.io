Afterwards, objects with fair value, such as shells, furs, precious metals, etc., began to be used as convenient media of exchange. Since these items were both commodities and currencies, they became collectively known as commodity money.<br>

Coins were named after their shape as a spade or weeding tool. Spade money, for example, was a bronze coin based on the "Bu" (a bronze agricultural tool).<br>

The hoof-shaped silver sycee was also known as "Horse Hoof Silver".
